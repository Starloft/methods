### Coin Flipper GET project

This project will record the users guess of 'heads' or 'tails' via a HTML button in a web browser using a GET and
compare the guess to a randomly generated result of a coin flip. The webpage will update to show the result and 
the user can repeat the action as many times as they wish.
