### Carnival_Number_Guesser GET project

This project will take an argument via the command line in a web browser using a GET and check to see if the number passed is the correct one. The webpage will update with a hot/cold type response and you can guess again to get closer. The number will be hard-coded into the web application in order to allow the user to keep trying and have better than a one percent chance of guessing as the feedback helps them get closer.
