# FizzBuzz in Java

Created by Joshua Stephenson-Losey

## How to Run

Depending on if you use an IDE or not this step will be different so I will give instructions for a the two possibilities that are readily available and somewhat compatable across use cases.

### - Visual Studio Code or the command prompt/ terminal

This was writted using visual studio code which has many java debuggers and language support extentions however they dont seem to support user input from the terminal window as required by this program (its more set up for running test cases on java files) thererfor if using VSCode the terminal window is used to compile and run the code ussing these steps:

1) Open the terminal window in the directory containing the FizzBuzz.java file.
2) Type in the following where the first line creates a .class file and the second executes it:

    `javac FizzBuzz.java`

    `java FizzBuzz`
3) That starts the program running now just follow the prompts!

### - IntelliJ and simmilar IDE's

1) Create a new project with the standard settings, name it something meaningful (like FizzBuzz) and put it somewhere you can find it
2) Place the FizzBuzz.java file in the src folder (you can drag it right into the program and it will prompt you to move it)
3) Right click on the FizzBuzz file (in Intellij) and click the run option (about halfway down)
4) That starts the program running now just follow the prompts!
