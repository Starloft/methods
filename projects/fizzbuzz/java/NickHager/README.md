-FIZZBUZZ-

A simple program that takes an integer (n) from a user and print from 1 to n in the console.
As the program prints, if a number is divisible by 3 or 5 then 'Fizz' or 'Buzz' is printed
instead, respectively. Both 'Fizz' and 'Buzz' may be printed at the same time for numbers that
are divisible by both. 

HOW TO USE

1) Either import the entire project from fizzbuzz/java/NickHager into your preferred JAVA IDE 
or navigate from fizzbuzz/java/NickHager to ../src/fizzbuzz to gain direct access to Main.java
and copy the file or the file contents into your preferred JAVA IDE.

2) Once the project is ready to be run, go ahead an run it. 

3) In the console, the user will be prompted to provide a number. Enter a number and press Enter
and the results will be printed in the console. 
	note: if an incorrect input is provided (e.g. a string) an error message will print. 
	

TESTING

1) After importing the entire project into your IDE, you may have to configure run/debug settings
to run the tests rather than the main class. 

2) Run the tests and the results should show.
